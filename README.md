Friends&Foes adds all eliminated mobs from the minecraft mob votes along with the forgotten mobs like the Illusioner. One of the main goals is to also further expand upon original concepts and add new vanilla like features related to all the mobs.

You can check [wiki] for a detailed overview of implemented features. Also feel free to [report crash/bug, share your ideas or give some feedback].

## Support

I will continue to develop my mods regardless of any support as it is my hobby and I very much enjoy it. If you want to support me anyway you can
do that on [Patreon] or [Ko-fi], I appreciate that.

## License, source code and other resources

The mod is licensed with [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0] license.

Feel free to look over my code for examples of how I have implemented and solved various problems while writing this
mod, incorporate snippets into your own.

You can also look into the [blockbench directory] which contains all the models & palettes and into
the [textures directory] for the textures. Get inspired, but please don't just copy & paste any of it as your own.

## Credits (thank you)

This mod would not exist in the state as it is without the following people:

- [Furti Two] - Made some of the models and most of the textures
- [LlamaLad7] - Support with everything mixin related (conflicts, extending enums)
- [TelepathicGrunt] - Support with structure generation related stuff and things (and also with Forge)
