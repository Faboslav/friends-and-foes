Friends&amp;Foes adds outvoted and forgotten mobs from the mob vote. One of the main goals is to further expand upon original concepts and add new vanilla-like features related to all the mobs.

## Support

I will continue to develop my mods regardless of any support as it is my hobby and I very much enjoy it. If you want to support me anyway you can
do that on [Patreon] or [Ko-fi], I appreciate that.

## License, source code and other resources

The mod is licensed with [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0] license.

Feel free to look over my code for examples of how I have implemented and solved various problems while writing this
mod, incorporate snippets into your own.

You can also look into the [blockbench directory] which contains all the models & palettes and into
the [textures directory] for the textures. Get inspired, but please don't just copy & paste any of it as your own.

## Credits (thank you)

This mod would not exist in the state as it is without the following people:

- [Furti Two] - Made some of the models and most of the textures
- [LlamaLad7] - Support with everything mixin related (conflicts, extending enums)
- [TelepathicGrunt] - Support with structure generation related stuff and things (and also with Forge)
